RCHC is a member-directed non-profit dedicated to providing quality, affordable housing for students and community members at a cost below that of the Iowa City market average.  RCHC was formed in 1977 by members of the University of Iowa Student Senate as a response to the lack of affordable housing options in Iowa City; however, we are not U of I-affiliated. We are a cooperative alternative to the traditional landlord-tenant relationship and currently own three historic homes, with a combined 36 rooms, near downtown Iowa City. 

Our mission is to provide quality housing for students and community members at a cost below that of the Iowa City market average. Quality housing includes good maintenance, caring landlords (ourselves), and a healthy social environment.
