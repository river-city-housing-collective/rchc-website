  - question: Who owns River City Housing Collective's houses?
    answer: River City Housing Collective, Inc.--RCHC is an incorporated 501c3 nonprofit. RCHC owns our assets, but the membership controls them.

  - question: Do members own shares?
    answer: No, members do not purchase shares. Our members do not build equity or receive dividends. Members sign a leasing agreement for a room at one of our houses in exchange for affordable rent, democratic control, and community living. 

  - question: If members don't own the houses, then what does your vision statement mean by 'instilling a sense of ownership?'
    answer: While you are an active member of RCHC, you will exercise all of the responsibilities of home ownership, including the care and maintenance of our property.  

  - question: Who's in charge?
    answer: All active members are allowed to have a voice in decisions for the Collective and their House.  Instead of a landlord, RCHC is managed through the consensus-based decision making of its general membership, member-run committees, and elected officers.
