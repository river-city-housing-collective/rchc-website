RIVER CITY HOUSING COLLECTIVE is a nonprofit cooperative dedicated to providing quality, affordable housing to the Iowa City area. Our members live in one of three historic homes, a short walk from downtown Iowa City and the University of Iowa campus.

Unlike other rental opportunities, RCHC is managed and operated through the collective efforts of our members, not a landlord. Shared responsiblity for cooking, cleaning, maintenance, and administrative tasks allows RCHC to continue to grow in its mission of sustaining a healthy physical and social environment for all of its members.
