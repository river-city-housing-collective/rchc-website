River City Housing Collective is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing quality housing for students and community members at a cost below that of the Iowa City market average. We are our own landlords, so our houses are managed and operated through the collective efforts of our members. Shared responsibility for cooking, cleaning, maintenance, and administrative tasks allows RCHC to continue to grow in its mission of sustaining a healthy physical and social environment for all of its members. You rent a room, but you join an amazing community of talented and passionate individuals.
